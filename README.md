## Introduction

The OpenV2X open source project will realizes a V2X edge cloud control platform that supports roadside, vehicle and comprehensive data fusion perception analysis, North-South interface of transaction data, North-South interface of operation and maintenance management; 52 basic functions such as equipment, GIS and comprehensive visualization management will be realized; Openv2x will complet 17 typical application scenarios such as intersection collision warning, no pass warning, vulnerable traffic participant collision warning, perception data sharing, collaborative lane change in the first phase. And will complete  12 typical applications in the second phase such as perception data sharing, cooperative lane change, and cooperative merge. The OpenV2X open source project builds a digital foundation for intelligent transportation by providing information services, ensuring traffic safety, improving traffic efficiency, and realizing autonomous driving and other typical application scenarios, enabling autonomous driving and autonomous transportation.
